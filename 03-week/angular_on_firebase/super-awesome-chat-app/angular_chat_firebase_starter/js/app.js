angular
    .module('chatApp', ['firebase']);

        // add 'firebase' as a dependency here! What this means is that our module depends on firebase in order to run properly. We simply add the names of any other modules we need into the array.
        //make sure theres no empty string, then add firebase with string when it will be the time to do it
