##CodeSchool/Google DevTools Course
Go through at least the following 3 lessons in [CodeSchool](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/?locale=en):

* 1.1 Dom Manipulation
* 1.2 Updating Styles
* 4.1 Debugging JavaScript

If you want to, go through all of them. There's a lot of amazing tools in there - including the "sources" panel (which is like an IDE), and profiling Network, Processor, and Memory performance.
