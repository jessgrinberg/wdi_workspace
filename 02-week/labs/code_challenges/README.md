#Code Challenge Lab!

Before you go to an interview you will likely be given a timed, online code challenge.

During a real interview, you will likely also be asked to write some code on a whiteboard to solve challenges (this is actually slightly easier, because you can get away with minor syntax errors if your logic is clear).

The challenges that we will do today are very similar to the ones you will come across before and during your interviews.

We will try some of these challenges using a coding practice called "pair programming". This is where two programmers share a single computer. One programmer is the "driver" and types out all the code. The other programmer is the "navigator" and tells the driver what to write. The navigator should not type anything at all. After a pre-defined time, the two programmers swap roles.  

It is counter intuitive, but 2 people working at a single computer will add as much functionality as two people working separately except that the code will be much higher in quality. With increased quality comes big savings later in the project.

Pair programming is a social skill that takes time to learn. You are striving for a cooperative way to work that includes give and take from both partners. The best pair programmers know when to say "let's try your idea first."
